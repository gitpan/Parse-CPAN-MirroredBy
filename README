NAME
    Parse::CPAN::MirroredBy - Parse MIRRORED.BY

DESCRIPTION
    Like the other members of the Parse::CPAN family Parse::CPAN::MirroredBy
    parses and processes the CPAN meta data file MIRRORED.BY.

METHODS
  new
    Creates a new, simple, parser object.

  add_map
      # Instead of the full hash just read the hostname
      $parser->add_map( sub { $_[0]->{hostname} } );

    The "add_map" method adds a map stage to the filter pipeline.

    A single element is passed into the provided function from the previous
    pipeline phase, and one or more values can be returned which will be
    passed on to the next pipeline phase.

    Returns true if added, or throws an exception if a non-CODE reference is
    provided.

  add_grep
      # We only want the daily mirrors
      $parser->add_grep( sub { $_[0]->{frequency} eq 'daily' } );

    The "add_grep" method adds a grep phase to the filter pipeline.

    A single value is passed into the provided function, and the function
    should return true if the value is to be kept, or false if not.

    Returns true if added, or throws an exception if a non-CODE reference is
    provided.

  add_bless
      # Bless into whatever objects
      $parser->add_bless( 'Foo::Whatever' );

    For situations in which you wish to convert the pipeline values into
    objects directly, and don't want to do it via a map phase that passes
    values into a contructor, the "add_bless" method allows you to provide a
    class name that the elements of the pipe will be passed to.

  parse_file
      my @mirrors = $parser->parse_file( 'MIRRORED.BY' );

    Once the parser is ready to process the file, the "parse_file" method
    can be provided a file name to read. It will read the file, passing the
    contents through the filter pipeline, and returning the resulting values
    as a list of results.

  parse
      my @mirrors = $parser->parse( $file_handle );

    Once the parser is ready to process the file, the "parse" method can be
    provided a file handle to read. It will read from the file handle,
    passing the contents through the filter pipeline, and returning the
    resulting values as a list of results.
